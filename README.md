# Theia OCR - Swift iOS
Handwriting recognition application for iOS. This application is currently limited to the uppercase-English alphabetic and numberic characters. The more the application is used while running, the more it learns from the users' handwriting, improving accuracy. 

Theia is a side project of mine, initially for an academic project that became increasingly big until it now has its own repo. More documentation and improvements <i>(lowercase characters, multiple line reads, algorithmic optimizations, etc...)</i> is expected in the future when I have more free time.
